## Overview

### The challenge

There are 5 criteria that must be met:
1. App should use local storage to save data.
2. User could add a new book.
3. App should have two libraries for the books.
4. User could move book between the libraries.
5. User could remove the books.

2. Finish and Repeat
You can see the finish and repeat button when you already add the book.
- Finish button (Selesai) will move the book to the "Finished Read" library.
- Repeat button (Ulangi) will move the book back to the "Unfinished Read" library.

3. Remove book
This button (Hapus) will give you a confirmation dialog whether you want to remove the book from local storage or you cancel it.

4. Edit book
You can found this on edit button in book's card. You can edit the data of the book.

5. Search book
The last feature that I want to present you is "search book". You can search the title of the books.

### What I learned
I learned to use local storage as a temporary place to saved data. But, you can use database to save the important data, such as book data in this final project. 

As a reminder, there are certain type and version of web browser that did not support web storage. You can see the detail on [here](https://caniuse.com/?search=webstorage).
